# Product Recommendation System Pipeline

This repository contains a modular Machine Learning pipeline designed to provide product recommendations based on historical retail data.

## Project Overview
The system is built to handle raw online retail datasets, perform data cleaning, and generate a recommendation model. It demonstrates proficiency in:
* **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and filtering transactions.
* **Model Serialization**: Training and saving models for real-time inference.
* **Modular Programming**: Organized code structure for scalability.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Prepare the data:  
   `python preprocess.py`
3. Train the model:  
   `python train.py`
4. Get recommendations:  
   `python predict.py`

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas
* Pickle
* Machine Learning Lifecycle Management
